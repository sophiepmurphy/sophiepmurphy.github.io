<h2>Projects</h2>
<p><strong>Customized Sector Benchmark Research Project – HIMCO</strong><br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> As the capstone project of my Investment Portfolio Management internship at Hartford Investment Management Company (HIMCO), I conducted a comprehensive research initiative exploring the feasibility and merits of creating a customized benchmark for Private Asset-Based Lending (ABL). I analyzed sector dispersion, portfolio composition, and return characteristics to assess the limitations of traditional benchmarks and develop a more representative alternative. The project culminated in a formal presentation to senior portfolio managers, where I proposed actionable insights to enhance relative performance measurement and portfolio strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed Income Trading Simulation – HIMCO</strong><br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> I participated in an 8-week fixed income trading simulation focused solely on bond markets. I was responsible for tracking macroeconomic trends, predicting rate movements, and executing trades based on real-time developments. The game emphasized strategic decision-making and risk management under time pressure, helping me develop a deeper understanding of market behavior and fixed income portfolio dynamics. My consistent engagement with market data and disciplined trading approach improved my ability to interpret economic signals and respond to changing conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Entrepreneurial Finance Project – Georgia Tech</strong><br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> As part of my Entrepreneurial Finance course, I collaborated with a small team to develop a startup concept for a subscription-based toy box service targeting parents with young children. I led the financial modeling effort, building an Excel model that projected earnings, quarterly sales, and customer acquisition over a five-year hypothetical period. Our team refined the pitch with faculty guidance and presented the business plan to real venture capitalists in Atlanta for evaluation. The project sharpened my financial forecasting, presentation, and entrepreneurial thinking skills.</p>
