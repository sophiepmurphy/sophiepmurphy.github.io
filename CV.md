    <h2>Letter</h2>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> April 22, 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Dear Hiring Manager,</strong></p>
    <p>I am writing to express my strong interest in the full-time Assistant Investment Analyst position at Hartford Investment Management Company (HIMCO). After interning with the Private Asset-Based Lending (ABL) team during Summer 2024, I am excited about the opportunity to return and contribute full-time. My internship confirmed my passion for investment research and analytics, and I am eager to grow within HIMCO's collaborative, performance-driven culture.</p>

    <p>As an Investment Portfolio Management Intern, I undertook a capstone project focused on creating a customized sector benchmark for Private ABL. This experience allowed me to explore portfolio construction and sector dispersion analysis in-depth, culminating in a formal presentation to senior portfolio managers. In addition, I developed Excel-based frameworks to enhance sector exposure tracking, contributed to credit memos by analyzing legal and maintenance documentation, and participated in a fixed income trading simulation that sharpened my understanding of macroeconomic influences and risk management.</p>

    <p>Beyond my internship, I’ve refined my leadership, time management, and communication skills as a Division I student-athlete and team captain on the Georgia Tech Swim and Dive team. Balancing 20+ hours of weekly training with rigorous academics has instilled in me the discipline and drive I will bring to this role. I’m also confident working with tools like Excel, Bloomberg Terminal, and Capital IQ, and I continue to expand my knowledge of Python for data analysis.</p>

    <p>I am excited about the opportunity to further my career with HIMCO and contribute meaningfully to the Private ABL team. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of joining HIMCO full-time and would welcome the opportunity to speak further.</p>

    <p><strong>Sincerely,</strong><br>
    Sophie Murphy</p>
