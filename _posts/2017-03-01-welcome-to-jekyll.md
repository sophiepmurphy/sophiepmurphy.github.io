I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, pursuing a B.S. in Business Administration with a concentration in Finance. I will be joining Hartford Investment Management Company (HIMCO) as an Assistant Investment Analyst in Summer 2025.

In Summer 2024, I interned at HIMCO on the Private Asset-Based Lending team, where I worked on credit underwriting, legal documentation review, and a capstone project exploring the feasibility of a customized sector benchmark. Previously, I interned with COVER Networks, a VC-backed startup, where I contributed to investor reporting, financial modeling, and operational strategy.

My professional interests lie in:

Credit & Fixed Income

Portfolio Management

Private Markets

Financial Modeling & Analysis

In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I serve as a team captain for Georgia Tech’s Division I Swim and Dive Program, where I’ve developed leadership, time management, and communication skills that extend far beyond the pool.
