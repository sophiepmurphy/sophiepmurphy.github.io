    <h1>Hi, I'm Sophie Murphy</h1>
    <p class="tagline">Assistant Investment Analyst · Georgia Tech Student-Athlete · Co-Captain </p>

    <p>
      Welcome to my professional site! I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, pursuing a B.S. in Business Administration with a concentration in Finance. I will be joining Hartford Investment Management Company (HIMCO) as an Assistant Investment Analyst in Summer 2025. 
      <p>
      In Summer 2024, I interned at HIMCO on the Private Asset-Based Lending team, where I worked on credit underwriting, legal documentation review, and a capstone project exploring the feasibility of a customized sector benchmark. Previously, I interned with COVER Networks where I contributed to investor reporting, financial modeling, and operational strategy.
     </p>
My professional interests lie in:
Credit & Fixed Income
Portfolio Management
Private Markets
Financial Modeling & Analysis
</p>
In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I serve as a team captain for Georgia Tech’s Division I Swim and Dive Program, where I’ve developed leadership, time management, and communication skills that extend far beyond the pool.


    </p>

    <p>
      From custom benchmark research to trading simulations and entrepreneurial ventures, I’ve pursued projects that stretch both technical skill and creativity. As a 2-year team captain and record-setting athlete, I bring energy and focus to everything I do.
